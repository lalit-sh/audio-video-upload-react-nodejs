#### TechStack
ReactJs, NodeJs, MongoDb

## Development

Take the clone of the app and run

### Step 1: Env Setup:

Install and setup mongodb

Install and setup NodeJs

### Step 2: Start Front-End
Front-End (ReactJs) app is maintained in a separate repository so you need to update git submodule to get the FrontEnd Code

`git submodule update --init`

then 

`$ cd ui`

`$ npm i`

`$ npm run start`

### Step 3: Setup env vars

Just rename .env.sapmle to .env and update the db credentials

### Step 4: Run Server
In a separate terminal open the project and run

`$ npm i`

`$ npm run start`

or

`npm run debug` 

## Deployment

Goto root of the project and run

`$ npm run build-ui`

and then deploy to your desired server.

Note: If you are deploying on a dedicated server like AWS ec2 machine then you have to build UI separately after taking a clone of the app over the server. Check out the development setup part for instructions.
